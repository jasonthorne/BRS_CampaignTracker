odd players:

randomise pairings: a b c

ab - c 
bc - a
ca - b

everyone played everyone, so randomise again: c b a

cb - a

everyone now player 4 times, so advance period:

ba - c
ac - b

everyone played everyone, so randomise again


===============

even players:

randomise pairings: a b c d

ab cd 
ac bd [1st - 1st, 2nd - 2nd]
ad cb [1st - 2nd, 2nd - 1st]



//==========================================
Each campaign turn covers one month. In each month, one mission can be run by the squadron. 
Experience and losses are accrued for the mission, and replacement pilots arrive at the end of the month. 
At the end of four months, the campaign advances one block (i.e. “early” to “mid”), and new kinds of aircraft become available for future missions. 
It is suggested players keep a mission log to track experience and losses. 

add everyone to array (add a buy player if player number is odd), randonmly shuffle array,
randomly pull someone from array
randomly pull them a partner. repat untill everyone is matched - record who got the buy.

next seeding, make sure that the person who got the buy last time doesnt get it this time
(make new array for them with only non buy players and pull them a partner, then nuke that array. )

//+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 number of missions in a turn
4 Turns in a period
THEN UPDATE PERIODS 
Then update planes

-Make a turn
-Make x pairings (give each pairing a mission)
- once everyones finished their missions: check if everyones now played everyone else:
 If so, reseed. 
Check if everyones now played 4 missions: 
if so move period, update planes, force players to change planes if their now unavailable.

 
 - reseed once each player has played everyone else (Including new players added before last reseed)
-Once everyone's played 4 missions: move periods, update planes, force players to change planes if their now unavailable.
